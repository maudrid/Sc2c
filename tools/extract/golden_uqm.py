"""Record reference ("golden") behaviour from UQM's own C code.

Builds the programs in tools/extract/golden/ against the UQM 0.8.0
source, linking UQM's real flight and math code, and writes their output
to tests/golden/. The C# port is tested against these files, so it has
to match UQM frame by frame.
